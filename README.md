# Neon Mirrors Call for Design
A public request for a graphic design for Neon Mirrors blog.

---
Hi and thanks for seeing if you can help me out here. I'm looking for a graphic artist to design a logo and brand for my new personal blog called Neon Mirrors. The name sounds a little odd so let me explain what this means and a bit about who I am so that it may help you in your creative design process.

### About Me

I am an IT professional working in the area of cloud computing, specifically in the area of cloud-native applications. Prior to that, however, I was classically trained as a musician (oboe) and had a particular affinity for French music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism). I've been a musician since I was about 13 and have always simultaneously had an interest in science and technology. Art and technology are often seen as competing disciplines, yet I began to bring those two together many years ago. I also am one of the founders, chief contributors, and administrators of [IMSLP](www.imslp.org), which is the world's largest "Wikipedia-like" library of music scores on Earth. I am both of these things, not at odds with one another but in harmony. I think this is important to know about me right away. Ideally, I would wish for you to know my personality and observe me, but we obviously don't have time for that. I'll try and give as much info otherwise as I can.

### Origin of the Name

I came up with the name Neon Mirrors because of that duality between science and art. Neon was discovered and first patented by a French scientist named Georges Claude in 1915. For more details on that, you can read [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-neon-signs-1992355). It fundamentally works by collecting gas in a tube and applying voltage to it making it glow. This is one of the more significant technological inventions to come out of France in the early 20th century. The "Mirrors" portion is a nod to one of the most transformative [works for the piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroirs) around the same point in time composed by Maurice Ravel. I ask you please listen to this piece in its entirety as research. More recordings and the full scores can be found [here](https://imslp.org/wiki/Miroirs_(Ravel%2C_Maurice)). So the idea behind Neon Mirrors is a marrying of the scientific with the artistic from turn-of-the-century France. This has dual significance in that the early 20th century represented a period of profound change in both areas, specifically technology, and we are again experiencing that at the turn of this 21st century (a "mirror" across time--the same period straddled across two centuries). Because of this multi-leveled symmetry, I chose the name as it best represents who am I but also what I am trying to accomplish in my field of technology.

With some of the background out of the way, here are some notes on what I'm looking for and what I'm *not* looking for:

### Looking For:

* Elegant, modern, quasi-minimalistic design
* Intelligent, intellectual
* ~1600 x 500 format image (precise dimensions I don't yet know)
* Calm but beautiful
* Possibly incorporate some themes from Maurice Ravel's work, influences, time period, etc.
* Thoughtful color palette 
* Incorporate themes of "cloud" somehow ("cloud" is obviously used in the computing term but was a subject for much music in this period in France [Debussy Nocturnes which contains "Nuages" or "clouds" in French])

### Not Looking For:

* No traditional neon sign type stuff
	 * It's too easy to make this into a gaudy, Vegas-style neon sign. I do not want anything that obvious.
* Boisterous or bombastic
* Cartoony
* Aggressive
* "In your face"
* Basic "music notes scattered everywhere". I'm not opposed to using some very strategic piece of music, but if you're not a musician and/or don't understand what you're putting in there, don't. I'm not opposed to using a small fragment as a layer (again, has to be strategically, thoughtfully used), but what I don't want is things used just for look with no meaning.
* Cheap, chinsy design 
* Designs with a literal mirror in them. See earlier points about being cheap and obvious.

### What I Would Like From You

Before immediately accepting this job, I would like to see an online portfolio showcasing as many of **your** designs as possible (not those from a company you may represent). Please don't send me raw images over email, Twitter, Slack, etc. If you don't have a formal portfolio of works to present to prospective clients, I'm afraid I'll have to pass.

### How I'm Willing To Engage

I realize that many designers ask for partial payment up front, whether that is a deposit of half the projected amount or some other fee. This isn't going to work for me, primarily because I don't want to commit to one designer simply seeing works they've done for *other* people. This gives me no assurances you'll understand me, my needs, and what I'm looking for. Moreover, I can't tell you exactly what I want or give specifics on the precise design. If I could, I certainly would, but that's why I'm trying to find that special design that really "clicks" for me. I hope you understand that I'm not attempting to find ways to get something for free or avoid paying you entirely, because that's not who I am.

As a middle ground, I would recommend presenting one or more rough sketches of your ideas so I feel comfortable that the vision you have is similar to my ideals. It can be on the back of a bar napkin and snapped with your phone. I don't care. But I want to see something before I commit to paying for anything. You don't have to spend hours let alone days slaving away over your computer. Just get me **something** so I can determine if I want to move forward with you or not. And if I don't, please don't take it personally. It just may mean you and I may not be a fit for each other.

### Money Terms

I am expecting to pay something up to around $500 for a design that is truly magnificent, inspired, informed, and takes into consideration (and displays) the points I've mentioned above. However, for the right person and right design, I'm not only willing to go above this, but use you as the sole artist to expand into other areas of this blog including more logo design, image and graphic design, font design, and possibly an upcoming (hopeful) project around designing a whole theme based on the Hugo framework.

### Closing

I'm a thoughtful, introverted, detail-oriented, intellectual person with multiple interests, and I want a design that attempts to reflect that. The successful design candidate will be one which factors these things into heavy consideration in order to come up with a logo which carefully considers and implements these elements without being too busy or overt.

Lastly, I want to THANK YOU for considering this job. You have amazing skills I obviously lack or else I would have designed this myself. This logo will not only represent my blog but also represent me as a person, my interests, my poise, and my intentions. Thank you for considering this job and I look forward to seeing what you come up with! Please always feel free to contact me to bounce ideas off, ask me questions, or get any more info that you think might help in your creative construction process.
